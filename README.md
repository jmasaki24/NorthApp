NorthApp est. fall 2018

One fall day in 2017, a principal of a suburban/small town high school was looking for ideas.
Ideas to improve his school, a school amidst droves of weakness, left by the past administration.

A crucial element of any community is communication, for humans invented the written word in order to efficiently grow.
Without effective communication throughout the halls, from classrooms to homes, from whiteboards to notebooks, the future of his school lay dim.

Every day, the principal saw every student walk his halls, smartphone in hand. A handheld device capable of instant communication. Email was unpopular with the new generation, social media too risky and informal for the school.

If only the school could have its own social media-like application, but that proposition was too expensive, and may not be a holistic solution.

But, in this world dominated by making things mobile, it could double as a valuable learning experience for high schoolers. Capable students would be needed to guide themselves in this treacherous journey.

The computer science teacher was consulted, and arrangements were made.

What it is this repository is the very code that will one day, hopefully, be used by the entire high school community.
